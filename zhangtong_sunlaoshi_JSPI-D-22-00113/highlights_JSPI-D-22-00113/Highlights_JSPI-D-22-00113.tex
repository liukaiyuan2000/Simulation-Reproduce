\begin{itemize}

  \item  We study the adequacy test of the partial functional linear model
when the scalar predictors are measured with additive error.\\

  \item  A
U-statistic type test is proposed, and its asymptotic properties are rigorously proved
under the null and the alternative hypotheses.\\


  \item  The proposed test can
control the type I error well, and its power performance is satisfactory.
