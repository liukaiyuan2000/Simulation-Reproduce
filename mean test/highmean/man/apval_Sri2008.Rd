}
\description{
Calculates p-value of the test for testing equality of two-sample high-dimensional mean vectors proposed by Srivastava and Du (2008) based on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic.

\usage{

}
\arguments{
  \item{sam1}{
  an n1 by p matrix from sample population 1. Each row represents a \eqn{p}-dimensional sample.
}
  \item{sam2}{
  an n2 by p matrix from sample population 2. Each row represents a \eqn{p}-dimensional sample.

\details{
Suppose that the two groups of \eqn{p}-dimensional independent and identically distributed samples \eqn{\{X_{1i}\}_{i=1}^{n_1}} and \eqn{\{X_{2j}\}_{j=1}^{n_2}} are observed; we consider high-dimensional data with \eqn{p \gg n := n_1 + n_2 - 2}. Assume that the two groups share a common covariance matrix. The primary object is to test \eqn{H_{0}: \mu_1 = \mu_2} versus \eqn{H_{A}: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2}. Let \eqn{\bar{X}_{k}} be the sample mean for group \eqn{k = 1, 2}. Also, let \eqn{S = n^{-1} \sum_{k = 1}^{2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n_{k}} (X_{ki} - \bar{X}_k) (X_{ki} - \bar{X}_k)^T} be the pooled sample covariance matrix from the two groups.

Srivastava and Du (2008) proposed the following test statistic:
\deqn{T_{SD} = \frac{(n_1^{-1} + n_2^{-1})^{-1} (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)^T D_S^{-1} (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - (n - 2)^{-1} n p}{\sqrt{2 (tr R^2 - p^2 n^{-1}) c_{p, n}}},}
where \eqn{D_S = diag (s_{11}, s_{22}, ..., s_{pp})}, \eqn{s_{ii}}'s are the diagonal elements of \eqn{S}, \eqn{R = D_S^{-1/2} S D_S^{-1/2}} is the sample correlation matrix and \eqn{c_{p, n} = 1 + tr R^2 p^{-3/2}}. This test statistic follows normal distribution under the null hypothesis.

The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic was derived under normality assumption in Bai and Saranadasa (1996). Also, this function assumes that the two sample populations have a common covariance matrix.
