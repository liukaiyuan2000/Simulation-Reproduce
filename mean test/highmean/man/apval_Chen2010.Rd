Asymptotics-Based p-value of the Test Proposed by Chen and Qin (2010)
}
\description{
Calculates p-value of the test for testing equality of two-sample high-dimensional mean vectors proposed by Chen and Qin (2010) based on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic.
}
\usage{
apval_Chen2010(sam1, sam2, eq.cov = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{sam1}{
  an n1 by p matrix from sample population 1. Each row represents a \eqn{p}-dimensional sample.
}
  \item{sam2}{
  an n2 by p matrix from sample population 2. Each row represents a \eqn{p}-dimensional sample.
}
  \item{eq.cov}{
  a logical value. The default is \code{TRUE}, indicating that the two sample populations have same covariance; otherwise, the covariances are assumed to be different. 
}
}

\details{
Suppose that the two groups of \eqn{p}-dimensional independent and identically distributed samples \eqn{\{X_{1i}\}_{i=1}^{n_1}} and \eqn{\{X_{2j}\}_{j=1}^{n_2}} are observed; we consider high-dimensional data with \eqn{p \gg n := n_1 + n_2 - 2}. The primary object is to test \eqn{H_{0}: \mu_1 = \mu_2} versus \eqn{H_{A}: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2}. Let \eqn{\bar{X}_{k}} be the sample mean for group \eqn{k = 1, 2}.

Chen and Qin (2010) proposed the following test statistic:
\deqn{T_{CQ} = \frac{\sum_{i \neq j}^{n_1} X_{1i}^T X_{1j}}{n_1 (n_1 - 1)} + \frac{\sum_{i \neq j}^{n_2} X_{2i}^T X_{2j}}{n_2 (n_2 - 1)} - 2 \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n_1} \sum_{j = 1}^{n_2} X_{1i}^T X_{2j}}{n_1 n_2},}
and its asymptotic distribution is normal under the null hypothesis.
}

\value{
A list including the following elements:
  \item{sam.info}{
  the basic information about the two groups of samples, including the samples sizes and dimension.
}
  \item{cov.assumption}{
  the equality assumption on the covariances of the two sample populations; this was specified by the argument \code{eq.cov}.
}
  \item{method}{
  this output reminds users that the p-values are obtained using the asymptotic distributions of test statistics.
}
  \item{pval}{
  the p-value of the test proposed by Chen and Qin (2010).
