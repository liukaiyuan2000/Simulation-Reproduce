\title{
Empirical Permutation-Based p-value of the Test Proposed by Srivastava and Du (2008)
}
\description{
Calculates p-value of the test for testing equality of two-sample high-dimensional mean vectors proposed by Srivastava and Du (1996) based on permutation.
}
\usage{
epval_Sri2008(sam1, sam2, n.iter = 1000, seeds)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{sam1}{
  an n1 by p matrix from sample population 1. Each row represents a \eqn{p}-dimensional sample.
}
  \item{sam2}{
  an n2 by p matrix from sample population 2. Each row represents a \eqn{p}-dimensional sample.
}
  \item{n.iter}{
  a numeric integer indicating the number of permutation iterations. The default is 1,000.
}
  \item{seeds}{
  a vector of seeds for each permutation or parametric bootstrap resampling iteration; this is optional.
}
}

\details{
See the details in \code{\link{apval_Sri2008}}.
}

\value{
A list including the following elements:
  \item{sam.info}{
  the basic information about the two groups of samples, including the samples sizes and dimension.
}
  \item{cov.assumption}{
  this output reminds users that the two sample populations have a common covariance matrix.
}
  \item{method}{
  this output reminds users that the p-values are obtained using permutation.
}
  \item{pval}{
  the p-value of the test proposed by Srivastava and Du (2008).

\note{
The permutation technique assumes that the distributions of the two sample populations are the same under the null hypothesis.
